# Moons Gameboy Emulator
A simple C++ original gameboy (DMG) emulator for windows.
My first attempt at an emulator, it is far from cycle accurate but is still able to
practically emulate a variety of games.

# How to run
1) clone the repository and build the project, or download the application directly here
2) Aquire a valid DMG bootrom, and game ROM, tetris is a good shout :)
3) In the console, write [./emulator.exe BOOTROM_FILE] [GAME_ROM_FILE]
